            <p id="selftext">A team of physicists with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology has calculated more precisely how much faster time passes on the moon than on the Earth. The paper describing the math they used to make the calculations. Over The Past Decade several entities have made clear their intentions to intensify research and economic activities on the moon. Such activities have led many in the field to conclude that a standardized lunar time needs to be established—one that allows for synchronizing activities on the surface of the moon and also with those space vehicles that are in orbit around it and also in transit between the moon and the Earth.

        <p id="selftext">An exoplanet infamous for its deadly weather has been hiding another bizarre feature—it reeks of rotten eggs, according to a new Johns Hopkins University study of data from the James Webb Space Telescope. The atmosphere of HD 189733 b, a Jupiter-sized gas giant, has trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide, a molecule that not only gives off a stench but also offers scientists new clues about how sulfur, a building block of planets, might influence the insides and atmospheres of gas worlds beyond the solar system.
